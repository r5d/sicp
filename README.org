This is my [[https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/][sicp]] sandbox.

Exercises until 2.42 are written in GNU Guile Scheme. These are under
the =net= directory.

Exercises from 2.44 are written in Racket. These are under the =ex=
directory.

Racket dependencies:

#+begin_src sh
raco pkg install sicp
raco pkg install rackunit
#+end_src
